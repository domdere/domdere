# Dom De Re

## About

👋 Hi, I’m @domdere, a Game Developer and avid Functional Programmer based in Sydney, Australia.

I run a small game dev studio in Sydney called 👉[Irreverent Pixel Feats](https://irreverentpixelfeats.com) 👈.

We're working on our first commercial title, but also try and produce small free games during Game Jams and whatnot,
as well as providing work-for-hire for other developers working on bigger projects.
